# Intro:
 Job-com, more specifically job commissions, is a website built with react used to post gigs/tasks online, as well as accept them.

# Details:
 Built with React.js for the frontend, and using Google Firebase for the database and account authentication system. Will be using [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/) for the user interface theme. 

# Development tips:
1- Any time you want to add an element, check out the material ui page and choose what component you want to add.

2- Make sure to run npm install to avoid errors, in case the other devs installed any libraries

3- Check for an account before allowing posting or accepting a job AND in the signin page
